	  <h2>Programmes</h2>


	  <h3>Sing-Along</h3>
	  <p>
	    Trainees in a group would be led to sing a number of simple songs (together with actions for the songs if any). Trainees may also volunteer to lead other trainees in the singing for some songs. After the sing-along session, trainees will introduce themselves one by one to the rest of the trainees and volunteers and receive their nametags.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Trainees enjoy singing as much as we do. Singing together starts the weekly session in a light hearted and fun spirit, and helps increase trainee-to-trainee as well as trainee-to-volunteer bonding. For those trainees who cannot speak well, singing is a chance for them to learn to articulate words properly. Singing songs with actions will also help trainees with poor motor skills practice more of these skills.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Following the sing-along session will be a self-introduction session. Besides letting trainees practise the skills of introducing themselves, the self-introduction segment also helps trainees build up their confidence by getting them to speak to a group of people in familar surroundings. Trainees will also be taught to be courteous by saying 'Thank you' after receiving their name tags.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Volunteer's role</h4>
	  <p>
	    Guide trainees along in the singing of the songs and the performance of actions associated with the songs. Help out if the trainees have difficulties saying their names during the self-introduction segment. (i.e. by saying the trainees' names slowly to them so that they could attempt to repeat it.)
	  </p>

	  <h3>Curriculum development training</h3>
	  <p>
	    One or a few volunteers will conduct a one-hour long lesson to teach trainees skills which would be useful for their daily living and open employment in a classroom setting. The skills taught span quite a wide range, ranging from topics like how to tell the time and money concept to topics like sexual harassement and safety. One topic would usually be covered for one quarter before a new one is introduced so that trainees can pick up the skills better via the many opportunities for hands-on practical and trainees with slower learning capabilities may also benefit.

	  <h4>Volunteer's role</h4>
	  <p>
	    One or two volunteers will be attached to each trainee during the lesson. They will help explain and elaborate on the concepts being covered by the lecturer on a one-to-one basis, and guide the trainee along with the hands-on practise and worksheets, if any..
	  </p>

	  <h3>Physical training</h3>
	  <p>
	    One or a few volunteers will conduct an hour-long session with the intention of letting the trainees relax themselves or to pick up recreational skills. Sports and Games : Some simple physical activities or sports would be conducted for trainees to learn teamwork and exercise themselves physically. Favourite activities include captains' ball, kickboxing, aerobics. Ocassionally trainees would be brought for a walk to the areas surrounding Woodlands Gardens School to get them out into the open. Typical locations for walks include the nearby playground for trainees to engage in physical exercise.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Volunteer's role</h4>
	  <p>
	  Volunteers attached to the trainees will guide the trainee along and ensure their safety during the activities.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Teabreak</h3>
	  <p>
	    Trainees get a teabreak before heading for home. Before the meal, trainees would be made to wash their hands, given some coins and then made to 'queue up' for the food which they would have to 'pay for' according to displayed price tags. Once they have finished their food, they would be expected to brush their teeth and wash and dry the utensils.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The reinforcment of hygiene habits (washing hands and brushing teeth) ensures that the habits will be drilled into the trainees and become part of their daily routine at home. The need to 'pay' for the food reminds trainees that things are not for free in the outside world as well as provides them the oppurtunity for them to practise counting out the correct sums of money.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Volunteer's role</h4>
	  <p>
	    Attached volunteers will ensure that the trainees wash their hands before the meal, brush their teeth after the meal and wash and dry the utensils properly before returning them. For trainees who are weaker in their numerical skills, volunteers will also assist the trainees in counting out the correct amounts of coins when 'paying' for the food.
